To Do in Model:

 - Student count is not staying high enough... I think it's a function of house prices pushing students out

 - Need to set up for multiple population runs in scripted setting
 -- Should run up to 6 populations, 2 populations per housing set, recording data separately for each run

 - Prices change much more rapidly in unit types with more availability

 - Unemployed currently have same average income as the employed in new population

 - 2201 households make over 200k (out of 14,100) - seems a bit high

 - The population doesn't start out with any students in the dorms

 - Need to fix student so that it can handle grad students, etc.

 - When a sibling leaves the house, the other siblings don't always age
